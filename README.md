# HB-ReportScripts
All the powershell scripts used for the HB Installation Automation project are stored here due to their use outside of the installation test. 

These can be executed individually to help speed up passing various test cases.

You can download the scripts and run them by right clicking them and selecting run powershell. You can also make a batch file that executes multiple powershell scripts at one time.

Each script has comments which help explain the code which may need updating over time.
